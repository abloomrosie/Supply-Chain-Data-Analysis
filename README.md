# 📦 Supply Chain & Sales Analytics Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing supply chain operations and sales performance for a retail company to help businesses optimize operations and drive revenue growth. By leveraging Power BI, we develop interactive reports and dashboards based on key metrics such as revenue, profitability, delivery times, return rates, and customer behavior. The goal is to support businesses in enhancing supply chain efficiency, improving customer satisfaction, and making well-informed strategic decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Evaluate key metrics: **revenue, profitability, delivery times, return rates, and customer behavior**  
- Identify bottlenecks in **delivery operations and product returns**  
- Understand **regional and seasonal** sales trends  
- Provide **actionable recommendations** for business optimization

## ⚙️ Data Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning (Python):**
   - Remove duplicates, handle missing values
   - Convert date fields and compute delivery durations
   - Normalize text/categorical columns
   - Export cleaned dataset to `.csv` for use in Power BI

2. **Data Modeling & Feature Engineering (Power BI):**
   - Create DAX measures and calculated columns (e.g., delivery delay, return flag, profit margin)
   - Segment customers and product categories
   - Aggregate data by region, time, and segment

3. **Exploratory Analysis & Visualization (Power BI):**
   - Analyze revenue, profit trends, customer behavior, delivery performance, return rates, etc.
   - Identify high-performing products and underperforming regions

4. **Dashboard Design (Power BI):**
   - Create interactive dashboards with filters, slicers, and drill-throughs
   - Visualize insights across 6 main themes:  
     Revenue & Profitability | Delivery | Product | Customer | Region | Forecast
